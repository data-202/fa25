## Site Description
The pages on this site outline the coding components of the **DATA 202: Statistically Measuring and Modeling Social Justice** course at Howard University, taught by me: [Professor Nathan Alexander](https://professornaite.github.io).
The information on this page will serve as a technical <u>*companion*</u> to our Canvas site.

This page will support you in our course in the following ways:
-   Help you work with data sets and complete small tasks over time.
-   Walk you through measurement aspects of research questions relevant to modeling issues of social justice.
-   Integrate mathematical ideas and technical formulas into your work.
-   Support your use of theory in your statistical practice, and document reproducible code around social justice topics.

Our canvas site ([click here](https://canvas.howard.edu/courses/59441)) contains readings and is where you will submit <u>all</u> assignments.

*When turning in assignments on Canvas*:
-   Submit **PDFs** unless otherwise stated.  
-   Only standard links or clear Github repos (no shorteners).  
-   RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) is encouraged for integrating code and analysis.

### Next up: Overview
The overview will walk you through the technical flow of the course, show preview topics at the bottom of each page, and outline assignments.
